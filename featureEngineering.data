        The Andromeda Galaxy, named after the mythological 
        Princess Andromeda, also known as Messier 31, M31, 
        or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 
        kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth, 
        and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. 
        Its name stems from the area of the sky in which it 
        appears, the constellation of Andromeda. The 2006 
        observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed 
        that the Andromeda Galaxy contains approximately one 
        trillion stars, more than twice the number of the 
        Milky Way’s estimated 200-400 billion stars. The 
        Andromeda Galaxy, spanning approximately 220,000 light 
        years, is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, 
        which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and 
        other minor galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy's mass is 
        estimated to be around 1.76 times that of the Milky 
        Way Galaxy (~0.8-1.5×1012 solar masses vs the Milky 
        Way's 8.5×1011 solar masses).

        The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar 
        System. The descriptive "milky" is derived from the 
        appearance from Earth of the galaxy – a band of light 
        seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be 
        individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term 
        Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from 
        the Greek. From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band 
        because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. 
        Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into 
        individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Observations 
        by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky 
        Way is just one of many galaxies.

        The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies 
        of the gray wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) 
        is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the 
        wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.
        The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are 
        not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which 
        implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was 
        the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over 
        millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

        The origin of the domestic dog is not clear. It is known that the dog was 
        the first domesticated species. The domestic dog is a member of the genus 
        Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most 
        widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The closest living relative of the 
        dog is the gray wolf and there is no evidence of any other canine 
        contributing to its genetic lineage. The dog and the extant gray wolf 
        form two sister clades, with modern wolves not closely related to the 
        wolves that were first domesticated. The archaeological record shows 
        the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago, 
        with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. These dates imply 
        that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers 
        and not agriculturists.

        Washington, officially the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific 
        Northwest region of the United States. Named after George Washington, 
        the first president of the United States, the state was made out of the 
        western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by Britain in 
        1846 in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the 
        Oregon boundary dispute. It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state 
        in 1889. Olympia is the state capital. Washington is sometimes referred 
        to as Washington State, to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the 
        capital of the United States, which is often shortened to Washington.
